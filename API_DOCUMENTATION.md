### 2. `POST /api/fruits` - Create New Fruit (Admin)

**Purpose:** Adds a new fruit to the catalog.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/fruits \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Apple",
    "price": 10,
    "description": "Fresh red apple",
    "category": "General",
    "stockQuantity": 100,
    "rating": 4.5,
    "offerType": "NONE"
  }'
```

**Offer Types & Calculation Logic:**

The system uses a **progressive cycle logic**. Once the first batch is bought at full offer price, subsequent batches are discounted even further.

| Offer Type | Description | Logic (Price per unit P, Quantity Q) |
|------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| `NONE` | No offer | Total = P * Q |
| `BUY_1_GET_1_FREE` | Buy one, get one free | Pay for 1, get 1 free. Groups of 2. |
| `BUY_2_GET_3_FREE` | Buy 2, get 3 free | First 5 items = 2 paid. Every 5 after = 1 paid. |
| `BUY_3_GET_5_FREE` | Buy 3, get 5 free | First 8 items = 3 paid. Every 8 after = 1 paid. |
